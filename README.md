# Infleqtion research challenge at QRISE 2024: Quantum computer-aided design (QCAD) of atomic clocks 

## Challenge overview

In this research challenge you will discover ways to use quantum computers to improve the design of atomic clocks.

## Background: Quantum computation and atomic clocks

Atomic clocks are an extremely useful quantum technology. It's usage in GPS satelites has enormous real-world impact. That's why it's important to think about how quantum computers can be used to improve atomic clocks. For example, a quantum computer was recently used to design a [precise clock](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04435-4).

## Challenge details  

* Reproduce the results of [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04435-4) on a quantum computer of choice. If access to a quantum computer is not possible, use of a noisy simulator is fine. 
* Use the collected results to list the pros and cons of building atomic clocks out of [VQE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver).

* Form a theory about how fault tolerant quantum computers can be used to improve the design of atomic clocks. Use Misha Lukin's quote: "People already, I think, like Shimon, thinking about how to use some of these techniques to improve things like clocks" from [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ0OX3GvFoQ&t=4200s)  as inspiration.

## Submission criteria

Submit a GitHub repository with complete Python code under the Apache Licence for your project and a write-up of your results, which includes a brief description of what you learned by making atomic clocks out of VQE and how to use fault tolerant quantum computers to improve atomic clocks.
